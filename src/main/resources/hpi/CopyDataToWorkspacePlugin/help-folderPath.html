  Enter the path to a data storage directory. All data in this directory will
  be copied to workspace. Path should be relative to Hudson root path(HUDSON_HOME).

  For example, Hudson root path = "C:\tmp". Path to folder = "storage\task".
  Plugin will copy data from directory "C:\tmp\storage\task".

  Multiple data storage directories can be given, just separate them by "," (comma).
